## Remote MCP Server

Connect directly to Tavily's remote MCP server instead of running it locally. This provides a seamless experience without requiring local installation or configuration.

Simply use the remote MCP server URL with your Tavily API key:

``` 
https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key> 
```
 Get your Tavily API key from [tavily.com](https://www.tavily.com/).


### Connect to Cursor
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=tavily-remote-mcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IG1jcC1yZW1vdGUgaHR0cHM6Ly9tY3AudGF2aWx5LmNvbS9tY3AvP3RhdmlseUFwaUtleT08eW91ci1hcGkta2V5PiJ9)

Click the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Add to Cursor ‚¨ÜÔ∏è button, this will do most of the work for you but you will still need to edit the configuration to add your API-KEY. You can get a Tavily API key [here](https://www.tavily.com/).


once you click the button you should be redirect to Cursor ...

### Step 1
Click the install button

### Step 2
You should see the MCP is now installed, if the blue slide is not already turned on, manually turn it on. You also need to edit the configuration to include your own Tavily API key.
![](assets/cursor-step2.png)

### Step 3
You will then be redirected to your `mcp.json` file where you have to add `your-api-key`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tavily-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenAI 
Allow models to use remote MCP servers to perform tasks.
- You first need to export your OPENAI_API_KEY
- You must also add your Tavily API-key to `<your-api-key>`, you can get a Tavily API key [here](https://www.tavily.com/)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "tavily",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="Do you have access to the tavily mcp server?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

### Clients that don't support remote MCPs

mcp-remote is a lightweight bridge that lets MCP clients that can only talk to local (stdio) servers securely connect to remote MCP servers over HTTP + SSE with OAuth-based auth, so you can host and update your server in the cloud while existing clients keep working. It serves as an experimental stop-gap until popular MCP clients natively support remote, authorized servers.

```json
{
    "tavily-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>"
      ]
    }
}
```

## Tavily MCP server installation ‚ö°

### Running with NPX 

```bash
npx -y tavily-mcp@latest 
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Tavily MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@tavily-ai/tavily-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @tavily-ai/tavily-mcp --client claude
```

Although you can launch a server on its own, it's not particularly helpful in isolation. Instead, you should integrate it into an MCP client. Below is an example of how to configure the Claude Desktop app to work with the tavily-mcp server.


## Configuring MCP Clients ‚öôÔ∏è

This repository will explain how to configure [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) to work with the tavily-mcp server.

### Configuring VS Code üíª

For one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below:

[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&quality=insiders)

### Manual Installation

First check if there are install buttons at the top of this section that match your needs. If you prefer manual installation, follow these steps:

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "tavily_api_key",
        "description": "Tavily API Key",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "tavily": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
        "env": {
          "TAVILY_API_KEY": "${input:tavily_api_key}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "tavily_api_key",
      "description": "Tavily API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "tavily": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "${input:tavily_api_key}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring Cline ü§ñ

The easiest way to set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline is through the marketplace with a single click:

1. Open Cline in VS Code
2. Click on the Cline icon in the sidebar
3. Navigate to the "MCP Servers" tab ( 4 squares )
4. Search "Tavily" and click "install"
5. When prompted, enter your Tavily API key

Alternatively, you can manually set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline:

1. Open the Cline MCP settings file:

   ### For macOS:
   ```bash
   # Using Visual Studio Code
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
   
   # Or using TextEdit
   open -e ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
   ```

   ### For Windows:
   ```bash
   code %APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json
   ```

2. Add the Tavily server configuration to the file:

   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/api-keys).

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tavily-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
         "env": {
           "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
         },
         "disabled": false,
         "autoApprove": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Cline if it's already running.

4. When using Cline, you'll now have access to the Tavily MCP tools. You can ask Cline to use the tavily-search and tavily-extract tools directly in your conversations.
